  # Ad-hoc signed, not notarized. postflight strips the Gatekeeper quarantine

  caveats <<~EOS
    This build is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. Gatekeeper quarantine is
    cleared automatically by the cask postflight; if the app still won't open,
    right-click Dau.app in Finder → Open. Grant Accessibility + Input Monitoring
    in System Settings → Privacy & Security.
